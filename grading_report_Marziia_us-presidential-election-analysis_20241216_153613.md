            ## Detailed Breakdown

            ### Critical Items

#### R/Python cited (1.0/1 points)
*The paper properly cites R in the Introduction section, stating "We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to conduct our analysis". R is also included in the reference list with the citation "@citeR". Therefore, R is properly referenced in both the main content and the reference list.*

#### Data cited (1.0/1 points)
*The data used in the analysis is properly cited in the Introduction section, which states "We use around 14,000 aggregated polls compiled by sources FiveThirtyEight [@fivethirtyeight2024]." FiveThirtyEight is then included in the reference list with the citation "@fivethirtyeight2024". Therefore, the data source is properly referenced in both the main content and the reference list.*

#### Class paper (1.0/1 points)
*There is no indication that this is a class paper. The repository name "us-presidential-election-analysis" does not suggest it is for a class. The README file, paper title, and code comments do not mention anything about a class project. Therefore, the paper passes this requirement.*

#### LLM usage documented (1.0/1 points)
*The README file contains a separate section titled "Statement on LLM usage" which states "Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/*.txt." The chat history is provided in the file "other/llm_usage/usage.txt". Therefore, the usage of the ChatGPT LLM is properly documented, with the full chat history included.*

### Regular Items

#### Title (1.0/2 points)
*The title "Forecasting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Analyzing Poll Quality, Sample Size, and Regional Variations" is informative and explains the key aspects of the paper. The subtitle "Donald Trump Leads Kamala Harris by 0.6% Nationally with State-Level Battleground Trends Highlighted" conveys the main finding. There is no evidence this is a school paper.*

#### Abstract (4.0/4 points)
*The abstract is well-pitched to a non-specialist audience. It concisely answers what was done (forecasting the 2024 U.S. presidential election using aggregated polls), what was found (Trump leads slightly by 0.6%, with state-level battleground trends), and why it matters (poll characteristics and state factors shape election predictions). The abstract makes clear what we learn about the world from this paper - how poll quality, sample size, and state effects influence election forecasts. It is an appropriate length at 4 sentences.*

#### Introduction (4.0/4 points)
*The introduction is self-contained and provides all necessary context. It motivates the importance of election forecasting, details the specific factors examined (poll quality, sample size, state effects), clearly identifies the gap in existing national models, states what was done (modeling candidate success probabilities by state and nationally), summarizes key findings (narrow Trump lead, state dynamics matter), and outlines the paper structure. A reader could read only the introduction and understand the key aspects of the study. The length is appropriate at 4 paragraphs.*

#### Estimand (1.0/1 points)
*The estimand is clearly stated in the introduction section of the paper.qmd file: "Our estimand is the difference between the proportion of voters who prefer the Democratic candidate and the proportion who prefer the Republican candidate." This meets the criteria for this item.*

#### Data (8.0/10 points)
*The Data section thoroughly examines the dataset, providing broader context on the FiveThirtyEight source. Key variables are explained in detail, with information on measurement. Graphs and summary statistics give a clear sense of the data, covering poll quality, sample size, state breakdowns, vote percentages, and more. The visualizations are relevant and insightful, though a couple more summary tables could be beneficial. High-level data cleaning is mentioned. The section focuses well on the destination, not the journey. Appendices are used for additional polling methodology details. Just a bit more could be done to get to the exceptional level, but overall it exceeds expectations.*

#### Measurement (3.0/4 points)
*The data section of the paper.qmd file provides a discussion of the measurement process, explaining how the poll data was collected and what each variable in the dataset represents. While the explanation is acceptable, it could be more thorough in relating the dataset entries to the real-world phenomena they represent.*

#### Model (4.0/10 points)
*The model is implemented using a GLM with logistic regression, which is appropriate for the binary win/loss outcome variable. Key predictors like poll score, sample size, state, and party are included. The code filters for statistically significant variables (p < 0.05) and displays them in a table, providing some model checking. However, there are some issues:*

#### Results (8.0/10 points)
*The Results section effectively conveys the key findings through a combination of text explanations, summary statistics, and visualizations. The impact of poll quality and sample size on predictions is clearly demonstrated, with specific examples from battleground states. State-level effects are highlighted, showing the importance of regional variations. The prose explains and contextualizes the results well. Including a couple key regression output tables directly (in addition to the appendix) would further strengthen this section. But as is, it exceeds expectations in relaying the results.*

#### Discussion (8.0/10 points)
*The Discussion section includes strong subsections addressing what was done, what was learned, limitations, and future directions. Key findings on poll quality, sample size, and state effects are reiterated. The importance of understanding state-level dynamics is emphasized. Limitations around the binary party simplification, overlooking of timing effects, and poll independence assumption are noted. Valuable future directions are proposed, including time-series models, voter turnout predictions, Bayesian methods, and alternative data sources. The section could be slightly expanded, but overall it exceeds expectations in contextualizing the results and critically examining the work.*

#### Prose (4.0/6 points)
*The prose throughout the paper is coherent, concise, clear, and mature. It is free of noticeable typos or grammatical issues. The writing flows well and effectively communicates the key points. Academic terms are used appropriately without feeling forced. The paper avoids redundant phrasing. The prose is consistently high-quality and polished.*

#### Cross-references (1.0/1 points)
*The paper.qmd file uses cross-references to refer to figures and tables in the text (e.g., "Figure 1 shows the distribution of poll results over time."). This meets the criteria for this item.*

#### Captions (1.0/2 points)
*The figures and tables in the paper.qmd file have captions that describe their content. While the captions are acceptable, they could be more detailed to provide additional context and interpretation.*

#### Graphs and tables (2.0/4 points)
*The graphs and tables in the paper.qmd file are well-formatted, clear, and serve a clear purpose in supporting the analysis. They are appropriately sized and colored, with suitable significant figures. However, there is room for improvement in making them fully self-contained by including more informative titles and labels.*

#### Idealized methodology (6.0/10 points)
*The proposed methodology in the paper.qmd file is well-thought-through and would likely achieve the goals of the study. The author proposes using a logistic regression model to estimate the difference in voter preference between the Democratic and Republican candidates, which is a realistic approach. However, there are some issues with the methodology, such as not addressing potential sources of bias or discussing alternative modeling approaches.*

#### Idealized survey (2.0/4 points)
*The paper.qmd file includes a proposed survey with an introductory section, a set of questions, and a thank you section for respondents. The questions are generally well-constructed and in a logical order. However, there is room for improvement in the clarity and specificity of some questions.*

#### Pollster methodology overview and evaluation (6.0/10 points)
*The paper.qmd file provides an overview of the pollster's methodology, discussing the sampling approach, question wording, and weighting procedures. The author also evaluates the strengths and limitations of the methodology, such as the potential for non-response bias and the use of likely voter models. While the overview and evaluation are acceptable, there are some issues that could be addressed in more depth, such as the impact of different weighting methods on the results.*

#### Referencing (3.0/4 points)
*The paper.qmd file includes in-text citations and a reference list in the references.bib file. The references appear to be properly formatted. However, there is one minor issue: the citation for the election polls dataset is missing from the reference list.*

#### Commits (2.0/2 points)
*The GitHub repository shows a history of multiple commits with meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made in each commit. This meets the criteria for this item.*

#### Sketches (0.0/2 points)
*There is no "sketches" folder in the GitHub repository, so this item cannot be evaluated. The repository does not appear to include any sketches.*

#### Simulation (3.0/4 points)
*The simulation script is clearly structured and well-commented. It simulates key variables in a reasonably sophisticated way:*

#### Tests-simulation (3.0/4 points)
*The tests for the simulated dataset are provided in a separate script (04-test_simulated_data.R). The tests cover various aspects such as the number of rows and columns, validity of state names and party names, data types and ranges of numeric columns, and missing values. The tests use appropriate assertions and provide informative messages. However, the tests could be more comprehensive, such as checking for duplicate rows or testing relationships between variables.*

#### Tests-actual (3.0/4 points)
*The tests for the actual dataset are provided in a separate script (05-test_actual_data.R). Similar to the tests for the simulated dataset, these tests cover aspects like the number of rows, presence of expected columns, validity of state names and party names, data types and ranges of numeric columns, date format, and missing values. The tests use appropriate assertions and provide informative messages. However, the tests could be more extensive, such as checking for outliers or testing specific business rules related to the dataset.*

#### Parquet (1.0/1 points)
*The analysis dataset is saved as a Parquet file (election_polls_cleaned.parquet) in the data/analysis_data directory. This meets the criteria for this item.*

#### Reproducible workflow (2.0/4 points)
*The project has some elements of a reproducible workflow but with a few key issues:*

#### Miscellaneous (1.0/3 points)
*The repository is well-organized and includes a clear folder structure separating raw data, analysis data, scripts*

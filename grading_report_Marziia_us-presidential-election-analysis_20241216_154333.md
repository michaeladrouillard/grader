### Regular Items

#### Title (1.0/2 points)
*The title "Forecasting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Analyzing Poll Quality, Sample Size, and Regional Variations" is informative and explains the main focus of the paper. The subtitle "Donald Trump Leads Kamala Harris by 0.6% Nationally with State-Level Battleground Trends Highlighted" conveys the key finding. There is no evidence this is a school paper. The title and subtitle effectively communicate the paper's content and main conclusion.*

#### Abstract (3.0/4 points)
*The abstract provides a concise overview of what was done (forecasting the 2024 U.S. presidential election using aggregated polls), what was found (Trump leads slightly by 0.6% nationally, with key state-level trends like Trump leading Florida 51% to 49% and Harris leading Pennsylvania 52% to 48%), and why it matters (poll characteristics and state factors shape election predictions). It is pitched at an appropriate level for a non-specialist audience. To reach the exceptional level, the abstract could more clearly emphasize the novel contribution and takeaways about the world from this analysis.*

#### Introduction (3.0/4 points)
*The introduction provides relevant context on the importance of election forecasting, introduces the 2024 race between Harris and Trump, and highlights the value of aggregating polls. It identifies the gap around combining poll quality and state-level differences. The introduction states what was done (analyzing 14,000 aggregated polls), what was found (narrow Trump lead nationally with state dynamics), and why it matters (poll and state factors impact forecasts). It outlines the paper structure. To reach exceptional, the introduction could go into slightly more depth on the specific gap being filled and takeaways. But overall it enables the reader to understand the key points of the paper.*

#### Estimand (1.0/1 points)
*The estimand, which is the quantity of interest to be estimated in the analysis (the predicted vote share for each candidate in the 2024 US presidential election), is clearly stated in the introduction section of the paper.qmd file.*

#### Data (8.0/10 points)
*The data section thoroughly describes the dataset, including the source (FiveThirtyEight), key variables, and measurement details. Summary statistics and graphical analyses provide a clear sense of poll quality, sample sizes, state breakdowns, and vote percentages. The visualizations and accompanying discussions help the reader understand the distribution and relationships of key variables. To reach full marks, the data section could go into even more depth on data cleaning steps and limitations. But overall it provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset used for the election forecasting model.*

#### Measurement (3.0/4 points)
*The data section in the paper.qmd file provides an acceptable discussion of measurement related to the dataset. It explains how the poll data was collected and transformed into the variables used in the analysis. However, some additional details on the specific polling methodology and potential measurement issues could further strengthen this section.*

#### Model (4.0/10 points)
*The model is implemented using a generalized linear model (GLM) with logistic regression, which is appropriate for predicting a binary outcome (win/loss) based on the predictors. The code filters for statistically significant variables (p < 0.05) and displays them in a table, providing some model checking. However, there are several issues: - The model is not clearly presented with mathematical notation and plain English explanations. The components and variables are not well-defined or justified. - There is no discussion of underlying assumptions, potential limitations, or situations where the model may not be appropriate. - No evidence is provided of more thorough model validation and checking, such as out-of-sample testing, RMSE calculations, test/training splits, or sensitivity analyses. - The software used (R with tidyverse and broom packages) is mentioned in the code but not explicitly discussed. Overall, while the GLM approach seems reasonable, the model implementation lacks clear explanation, justification, discussion of assumptions and limitations, and robust validation. More details are needed to fully evaluate the model's appropriateness and performance.*

#### Results (8.0/10 points)
*The results section presents the key findings on how poll quality, sample size, and state-level factors impact election predictions. It highlights that higher quality polls and larger samples tend to moderate predictions, especially in battleground states. State-level breakdowns show strong regional differences, with tight races in key swing states. The included plot effectively illustrates how poll score and sample size influence win probabilities. To reach exceptional, the results could include some additional graphs or tables to visualize the state-level trends. But in general, the results are clearly explained and tied back to the election forecasting context.*

#### Discussion (8.0/10 points)
*The discussion recaps the key findings around poll quality, sample size, and state effects. It emphasizes the importance of high-quality polls and larger samples for accurate predictions, especially in competitive states. Limitations around the binary party simplification and poll independence assumption are noted. Future directions to explore time-series models, voter turnout, and alternative data are proposed. To reach full marks, the discussion could go into slightly more depth on the real-world implications and additional limitations. However, it does a strong job of synthesizing the results, addressing weaknesses, and suggesting next steps.*

#### Prose (4.0/6 points)
*The writing throughout the paper is clear, concise, and free of noticeable errors. The prose is polished and strikes an appropriate tone for an academic election forecasting paper. Key terms are explained and the flow of ideas is logical. Sentences are focused and paragraphs are well-structured. The writing style is consistent and mature, without informal phrases. Overall, the prose is of exceptional quality and effectively communicates the complex election modeling concepts to the reader.*

#### Cross-references (1.0/1 points)
*Figures and tables are numbered and referred to in the text using cross-references throughout the paper.qmd file.*

#### Captions (2.0/2 points)
*All figures and tables in the paper.qmd file have detailed and meaningful captions that provide excellent context for interpreting the visualizations and results.*

#### Graphs and tables (3.0/4 points)
*The graphs and tables in the paper.qmd file are well-formatted, clear, and serve a clear purpose in supporting the analysis. They are appropriately sized and colored, with suitable significant figures. The visualizations exceed expectations for effectively communicating the key findings.*

#### Idealized methodology (8.0/10 points)
*The proposed methodology section in the paper.qmd file presents a well-thought-through and realistic approach for achieving the study's goals. The plan to collect a large, representative sample through a multi-mode survey, use weighting to adjust for non-response bias, and apply a Bayesian model to estimate vote shares exceeds expectations for a rigorous and credible methodology.*

#### Idealized survey (3.0/4 points)
*The idealized survey in the paper.qmd file includes an introductory section, well-constructed questions in an appropriate order, and a thank you message for respondents. The survey design exceeds expectations for clarity, flow, and professionalism.*

#### Pollster methodology overview and evaluation (6.0/10 points)
*The paper.qmd file provides an acceptable overview and evaluation of the pollster's methodology, highlighting key strengths such as the large sample size and use of multiple modes. It also notes some limitations, like potential for non-response bias. However, a more detailed assessment of the specific sampling, weighting, and modeling approaches could further enhance this section.*

#### Referencing (4.0/4 points)
*All data, software packages, and literature sources are properly cited in-text and included in a correctly formatted reference list in the references.bib file.*

#### Commits (2.0/2 points)
*The repository contains multiple commits with meaningful commit messages that describe the incremental changes made to the project.*

#### Sketches (0.0/2 points)
*No sketches folder is included in the repository structure provided.*

#### Simulation (3.0/4 points)
*The script simulates a dataset for a U.S. Presidential Election analysis, including state, poll score, sample size, party affiliation, and vote percentage. The code is clearly structured and commented, making it easy to understand the simulation process. The variables are simulated using appropriate distributions and ranges: - States are randomly sampled from a predefined list of state names - Poll scores are simulated from a normal distribution - Sample sizes are randomly selected between 500 and 5000 - Party affiliations are randomly assigned with equal probability - Vote percentages are simulated uniformly between 30% and 70% The simulated data is then combined into a tibble data frame and saved as a CSV file. While the simulation approach is solid and well-implemented, it could be enhanced by incorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as using state-specific distributions based on historical data or modeling correlations between variables. Nonetheless, the current simulation exceeds expectations by providing a clear, well-structured script that generates a realistic dataset for analysis.*

#### Tests-simulation (3.0/4 points)
*The 04-test_simulated_data.R script contains high-quality tests for the simulated dataset, checking the number of rows/columns, validity of state names and party affiliations, ranges and types of numerical values, missing data, and uniqueness of key fields. The tests provide informative messages on success/failure. However, to achieve the top "Exceptional" score, the tests could be made even more comprehensive, e.g. by checking the distribution/statistical properties of the simulated data to ensure it matches the expected characteristics defined in the simulation script.*

#### Tests-actual (3.0/4 points)
*The 05-test_actual_data.R script contains high-quality tests for the actual election dataset, very similar in scope and implementation to the tests for the simulated data. It checks the loaded data for the expected number of rows/columns, validity of key fields, ranges of numerical values, missing data, and uniqueness. The tests are well-structured with clear success/failure messages. To achieve an "Exceptional" score, additional tests could be added to check for any dataset-specific issues or expected properties that are unique to the actual election data.*

#### Parquet (1.0/1 points)
*The analysis dataset is saved as a Parquet file (election_polls_cleaned.parquet) in the data/analysis_data directory.*

#### Reproducible workflow (1.0/4 points)
*The provided code files demonstrate some elements of a reproducible workflow, but there are several issues that need to be addressed: - The code is organized into separate scripts for data cleaning, modeling, and simulation*

#### Miscellaneous (1.0/3 points)
*The use of a reproducible Quarto document for the paper and the organization of the repository into clear subdirectories are notable positive aspects not directly covered by the other rubric items.*
